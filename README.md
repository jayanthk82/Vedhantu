Digital Brain is an application designed to assist learners preparing for competitive exams like JEE MAINS, GATE, and interviews by solving the problem of forgetting crucial information. Acting as a "robot tutor who never sleeps," the app manages the documentation and revision process to ensure 100% retention.


🚀 Key Features

• Multi-Modal Input: Users can quickly store formulas, facts, or notes by typing, speaking, or taking a photo of their notebook.

• Automated Spaced Repetition: The system fights memory decay by sending automated phone notifications at specific critical intervals: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 15 days after learning.

• Interactive Testing: Users can respond to revision prompts via chat-style typing, Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), or voice commands.

• Adaptive Scheduling: If a user answers correctly, the next review is pushed to a later date; if they answer incorrectly, the app schedules the next prompt sooner to ensure mastery.

⚠️ Project Status

This project is currently in the development phase for a full product launch.

Analogy: Think of this project as a gym for your memory; just as a personal trainer ensures you do not skip a workout to keep your muscles strong, Digital Brain uses notifications to ensure you do not skip "revision day," keeping your knowledge ready for competition.
